Task 3 ðŸš€ Prodigy InfoTech
Classification of cats and dogs with the help of SVM.

ðŸ”Ž Leveraging the power of Support Vector Machine (SVM), I built a robust classifier trained on a dataset of thousands of images.
ðŸ“ˆ SVM proved to be highly effective in separating the complex features of cat and dog images, allowing the model to make accurate predictions.

ðŸ“ˆ To prepare the images for training, I utilized OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) for preprocessing tasks such as resizing them to a standard size of 50x50 pixels, and more.

ðŸ“Š This project not only enhanced my understanding of machine learning algorithms but also provided valuable hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. ðŸ’¡
